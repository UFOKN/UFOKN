							<div class="col-md-6">
								<p>The Urban Flooding Open Knowledge Network (UF-OKN) is an informational infrastructure built using knowledge graphs
								aiming to extract structured content from the information scattered across open-source geospatial datasets and
								hydrologic models. A knowledge graph stores information in a machine-readable format and provides a way for information
								to be collected, organized, shared, searched, and used. Bing and Google use a similar approach to create side panels in
								our browsers. Currently, there is no way to connect information about urban infrastructure to real time hydrologic
								forecasts. It is the goal of this work to make it easier for the vast amounts of information regarding our built and
								natural environments to become more helpful for planning, response, and general use. We take a holistic approach for a
								better understanding of the short and long-term impacts of urban flooding so that we can mitigate the human and economic
								losses.</p>

								<h3>Knowledge Base</h3>

								<p>Knowledge graphs are playing an increasingly important role in enhancing the intelligence of Web search and in
								supporting information integration. Today, there is no set knowledge graph that relates urban systems with hydrologic
								forecasts. Our data will be served as Linked Data. One could navigate this information with standard web browsers,
								automated crawlers, or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the
								Web about cities with the roads most at risk of flooding over the last 10 years? That is the kind of query we are
								talking about. Moreover, users will be able to build their own interfaces on top of the graph to visualize, explore, and
								share the information they find most relevant.</p>

								<h3>Risk Points</h3>

								<p>Instead of treating the built environment and hydrologic system as two overlapping entities, we seek to identify the
								core explicit relationship between the conditions that cause problems and the infrastructure that will be impacted. To
								do this, we extract the key relationships between spatial objects (like OpenStreetMap building footprints and road
								networks) and relate them to their nearest river, and the critical streamflow that will inundate that location.</p>

								<p>Each point on the earth surface where there is a relationship between the built and natural environment can be
								considered a risk point, some obviously being more critical than others! Finally, we relate these risk points to
								operational forecasts from predictive models at a national (NOAA National Water Model) and local (e.g. HEC-RAS, SWMM and
								ICPR) scale providing real-time information and insight on level of risk at each point.</p>

								<h2>The Urban Multiplex</h2>

								<p>When an urban area gets heavy rainfall, the impact of flooding resulting from this rainfall event is dictated not just
								by the amount of rainfall, but how the physical infrastructure, such as the stormwater network, power stations and water
								retaining structures, is able to collectively absorb shocks produced by the flooding event. Most often, the emergency
								responders can see the impact of rising water levels on humans, but the impact on the urban infrastructure and its
								interconnected components, and its role in flooding is not visible or understood. All urban systems are interconnected.
								Impacts to the power grid will impact water treatment centers, houses, and emergency response activities.</p>

								<p>Understanding the impacts of flood begins with identifying which risk points will be impacted. From there, the way
								impacts cascade through the system depend on the relationships between different object types. As part of the UF-OKN, we
								are developing a rich ontology that generalizes the relationships between different feature types to help identify these
								impacts as we traverse the knowledge network.</p>

								<h2>Past, Present and Future</h2>

								<p>Real-time information is not the only thing that is useful for flood events. Often, we are interested in whether a
								location is at risk, if conditions have been changing through time, and how would future infrastructure investments
								affect risk to identify whether it is wise to invest in a location either as an individual or as a city. In addition to
								real-time and forecast flood information, the UF-OKN will provide access to a 24-year historical analysis product for
								the entire country along with the tools to produce easily digestible synopses of how and where flood risk has changed,
								and how it is expected to evolve in the future.</p>
