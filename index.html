							<h2>Urban Flooding<br />Open Knowledge Network</h2>
							<p>The Urban Flooding Open Knowledge Network (UF-OKN) is a knowledge graph aiming to extract structured content from the information scattered across open-source geospatial datasets and hydrologic models. A knowledge graph stores information in a machine-readable format and provides a way for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and used. Bing and Google use a similar approach to create side panels in our browsers. Currently, there is no way to connect information about urban infastructure to real time hydrologic forecasts. It is the goal of this work to make it easier for the vast amounts of information regarding our built and natural environments to become more helpful for planning, response, and general use.</p>

							<h3>Knowledge Base</h3>

							<p>Knowledge graphs are playing an increasingly important role in enhancing the intelligence of Web search and in supporting information integration. Today, there is no set knowledge graph that relates urban systems with hydrologic forecasts. Our data is served as Linked Data. One can navigate this information with standard web browsers, automated crawlers, or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about cities with the roads most at risk of flooding over the last 10 years? That's the kind of query we are talking about. Moreover users can build their own interfaces on top of the graph to visualize, explore, and share the information they find most relavant.</p>

							<h3>Risk Points</h3>

							<p>Instead of treating the built environment and hydrologic system as two overlapping entities, we seek to identify the core explict relationship between the conditions that casues problems and the infastrucuture that will be impacted. To do this we extract the key relationships betweeen spatial objects (like OpenStreetMap building foot prints and road networks) and relate them to their nearest river, and the critical streamflow that will innudate that location.</p>

							<p>Each point on the earth surface where there is a realtionship between the built and natural environment can be considered a risk point, some obviously being more critical than others! Finally, we relate these risk points to the operational NOAA National Water Model providing realtime information and insight on level of risk at each point.</p>

							<h2>The Urban Multiplex</h2>

							<p>All urban systems are interconnected. Impacts to the power grid will impact water treatment centers, houses, and emergency repsonse activities.</p>

							<p>Understadning the impacts of flood begins with identifying which risk points will be impacted. From there, the way impacts cascade through the system depend on the relationships between different object types. As part of the UF-OKN, we are developing a rich ontology that generlizes the relatioships between different feature types to help identify these impacts as we traverse the knowledge network.</p>

							<h2>Past and Present</h2>

							<p>Real-time information is not the only thing that is useful for flood events. Often we are interested in whether a lcoation is at risk, if conditions have been changing through time, and if it is wise to invest in a location either as an individual or as a city. The UF-OKN provides access to a 24-year anlysis product for the entire country along with the tools to produce easily digestable synopses of how and where flood risk is changing.</p>

							<p>The UF-OKN is the Weather Underground for flooding. We provide the critical information you need but how you use it is up to you! Users can build their own APIs, web maps, and applications on top of the UF-OKN. Whether this is for personal, public, or commercial use, the UF-OKN provides a central place for users to build on and contribute data.</p>

							<h2>Real-time Information</h2>

							<p>You just received a county-wide flash flood alert. What should you do? With the UF-OKN we can provide the general public and first responders with credible, actionable information to make decisions that best reflect their needs and interests. Is our inforamtion perfect? Of course not, but wouldn't you like to have the best state-of-the-art inforamtion at your finger tips when it matters most?</p>
